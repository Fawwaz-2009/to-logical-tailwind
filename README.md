# To Logical Tailwind (Tailwind CSS Logical Properties Transformer)

An online tool to convert Tailwind CSS classes in your components to their logical equivalents for RTL (right-to-left) support and, optionally, full logical properties support using the [Logical Tailwind plugin](https://github.com/stevecochrane/tailwindcss-logical).

## Introduction

This project aims to simplify the process of converting Tailwind CSS classes in your components to their logical equivalents for better RTL support and, if needed, comprehensive logical properties support using the Logical Tailwind plugin or Tailwind CSS v3.3+. It requires either Tailwind CSS v3.3 or higher, or the Logical Tailwind plugin in your project.

## Plugin vs. Native Comparison

The Logical Tailwind plugin provides more comprehensive support for logical CSS properties, while the native Tailwind implementation focuses primarily on RTL support. If your project requires full logical properties support, using the Logical Tailwind plugin might be a better option. However, if your project's main goal is to support RTL languages, the native Tailwind implementation, available from Tailwind CSS v3.3+, should suffice.
